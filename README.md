# find-findindex

I wrote functions that would pass the tests in the starter code. 

findUserByUsername:  Write a function called findUserByUsername which accepts an array of objects, each with a key of username, and a string. The function should return the first object with the key of username that matches the string passed to the function. If the object is not found, return undefined.

removeUser:   Write a function called removeUser which accepts an array of objects, each with a key of username, and a string. The function should remove the object from the array. If the object is not found, return undefined.
